Class & Object Creation
PHP: Uses class and the new keyword to instantiate objects.
Python: Uses class, but instantiation does not require new.

 Encapsulation
PHP: Uses public, protected, and private for access control.
Python: Uses _ (protected) and __ (private), but does not enforce strict access control.

Inheritance
PHP: Uses extends for single inheritance. Multiple inheritance is not supported (Traits can be used).
Python: Supports single, multiple, hierarchical, multilevel, and hybrid inheritance

Method Overriding
Both PHP and Python support method overriding, where a child class redefines a method from the parent class.


Method Overloading

Python: Supports method overloading using default arguments or @overload from typing.


Constructor
PHP: Uses __construct().
Python: Uses __init__().
